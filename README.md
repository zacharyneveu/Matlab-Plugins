About
=====
This repository contains source code for VST plugins created with MATLAB.  The 
eventual goal for this repository is to create one or more entries for the AES
student design competition in New York (Fall 2018).

Plugin Ideas
============
+ AI Drum Sequencer
    + Use AI/ML to categorize input sounds as similar to a type of drum
    + Sort samples into standard drum pad configuration
    + Manage sequencer/sampler functions for a track
    + Perhaps pull random audio samples from freesound to create spontaneous kits.
